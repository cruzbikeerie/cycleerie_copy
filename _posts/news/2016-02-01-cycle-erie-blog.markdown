#  Free Bicycle Rides

 The cost of a one day bicycle tours has been climbing. I know that many bike tours support charities, and other's goes in somebody's pocket. But if you want to go for a ride every weekend and paying 35 dollars or more is getting kind of expensive just to do a ride with other cyclist and maybe get a meal. If you are a couple your looking at 70.00 or more. If you have a wife and  two kids, you looking at paying out 140 dollars or more. This is a lot when you have a family to support or your on a fix income(Baby Boomers). Lets make Bicycle rides free and open to everyone.
With today's Technology, GPS's, Cell phone, and computer you can print out or store on your cell phone the maps and cue sheets. This would be a very small cost to you when you already have the devices.

## We need a Social Network for Erie Cyclists.
 We need a place where Erie Cyclist came meet other cyclist with the same abiltiies. If you want to train for a race,or just want to do a social ride out on Erie Counties Roads. I myself am a social rider who is slow compared to a racer, but I do enjoy  doing up-hill climbs with fast descents. We need some kind of forum where Cyclist can plan rides and  people would show up who also like to ride.
I myself have a group of 3 or 4 friends who I go riding with. Are there any other cyclist who would like to join me and my friends for a bike ride?

## About this web site (cost)

 I am keeping the cost of this web site and cheap as possible. The web site is hosted on [Git-Hub](https://github.com/) which is free. Right now I am keeping my images on Micosoft's One drive because Git Hub has a 1 gig limit. One drive let's you put them on a website. If somebody know of a free web server where I can store images for this blog let me know. [Click here](http://cycleerie.org/contact/) to let me know, Thanks
I am using [Jekyl](https://jekyllrb.com/)l for the blogging platform which is also free. All I am paying for is the domain name from Google Domains.
