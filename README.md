# Cycle Erie
There are two purposes for Cycle Erie
The first purpose of  Cycle Erie is to provide a blog for Erie Cyclist. 
The second purpose of Cycle Erie Web site is so I can learn more about Git Hub and Jekyll.
I got this page from [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/)
The Git hub site is  https://github.com/brianmaierjr/long-haul
